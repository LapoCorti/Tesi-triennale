TITLE: "Microrobotica in medicina: analisi e simulazione del movimento di particelle attive" 
AIM: The aim of this work is to analyze and simulate moviment of active particle. At the beginning we simulate active brownian motion for a single active particle, 
after we expanded the method by considering swarms of active particle (hardsphere correction).
